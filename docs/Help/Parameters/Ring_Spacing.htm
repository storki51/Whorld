<h3>Ring Spacing</h3>

<p>Ring Spacing is the amount of space between each ring, in pixels. Ring Spacing can be as big as you like, but it can't be less than one. It's one of several methods for controlling image complexity, and it's often necessary to increase it when using <a href="../Parameters/Line_Width.htm">wide lines</a> or <a href="../Effects/Fill.htm">fill</a>, to avoid <a href="../Loose_Ends/Performance.htm">performance</a> problems.
