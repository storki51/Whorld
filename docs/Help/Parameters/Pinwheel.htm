<h3>Pinwheel</h3>

<p>Pinwheel rotates the points of a star, causing the overall shape to resemble a pinwheel or turbine, as illustrated in the following diagram:

<p><img src="../images/Pinwheel.gif">

<p>Pinwheel is normalized such that at 1, each "tooth" has one of its edges (the "cutting" edge) positioned on a line that passes through the center. At &minus;1, the teeth face clockwise instead of counterclockwise. At zero, Pinwheel has no effect.

<p>Pinwheel is typically used in combination with <a href="../Parameters/Star_Factor.htm">Star Factor</a>, but it has an effect even when Star Factor is zero. Pinwheel's range is twice the ring's number of sides, i.e. for a six-sided ring, Pinwheel = 6 is the most extreme value, and Pinwheel = 12 is the same as Pinwheel = 0. Extreme values cause the ring to overlap itself in interesting ways, but may also reduce <a href="../Loose_Ends/Performance.htm">performance</a>.
