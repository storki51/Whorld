<h3>Patches</h3>

<p>A patch is a particular setting of the <a href="../Parameters/Parameters.htm">parameters</a> and their <a href="../Patches/Oscillators.htm">oscillators</a>. A patch can be saved to a file, and then restored from the file later. To open a patch, use <span class="cmd">File/Open</span>. To save the current patch, use <span class="cmd">File/Save</span> or <span class="cmd">File/Save As</span>.

<p>Patches are edited using the <a href="../Patches/Parameters_dialog.htm">parameters dialog</a>. Whorld has various buffers in which patches can be edited. The parameters dialog operates on one of these buffers at a time; see <a href="../Patches/Edit_Selection.htm">edit selection</a>.

<p>In addition to the parameters and their oscillators, a patch also contains other settings, which may or may not be restored, depending on the <a href="../Modes/Patch_mode.htm">patch mode</a>.
