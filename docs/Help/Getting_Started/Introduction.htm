<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Whorld is a free, open-source visualizer for sacred geometry. It uses math to create a seamless animation of mesmerizing psychedelic images. You can VJ with it, make unique digital artwork with it, or sit back and watch it like a screensaver.

<p>Whorld's visualization is controlled via <a href="../Parameters/Parameters.htm">parameters</a> which can be adjusted manually, or modulated by <a href="../Patches/Oscillators.htm">oscillators</a>. A given setting of the parameters and their oscillators form a <a href="../Patches/Patches.htm">patch</a>. You can use the <a href="../Getting_Started/Viewing_the_demo.htm">demo</a> patches, or create your own.

<p>Patches can be grouped together in a <a href="../Playlists/Playlists.htm">playlist</a>. You can <a href="../Playlists/Playing_patches.htm">play patches</a> manually, or Whorld can <a href="../Playlists/Autoplay.htm">autoplay</a> them for you. Whorld also includes a <a href="../Crossfader/Crossfader_dialog.htm">crossfader</a>, which allows you to <a href="../Crossfader/Interpolation.htm">interpolate</a> between two patches.

<p>Whorld is optimized for <a href="../Modes/Veejay_Mode.htm">performing</a>. All of its functions can be accessed in full-screen mode, via <a href="../Loose_Ends/Main_Shortcuts.htm">shortcut keys</a>, <a href="../Modes/Mouse_Modes.htm">mouse</a> or trackball, or <a href="../MIDI/MIDI_Setup.htm">MIDI controllers</a>. Whorld can be synchronized to music, using <a href="../Loose_Ends/Tap_Tempo.htm">tap tempo</a>, or <a href="../Options/MIDI/MIDI_sync.htm">MIDI clocks</a>.

<p>Still frames can be captured as <a href="../Snapshots/Snapshots.htm">snapshots</a>, printed, or <a href="../Loose_Ends/Export.htm">exported</a> as bitmaps. Whorld can also record <a href="../Movies/Movies.htm">movies</a>, and export them as AVI files or numbered bitmaps.
