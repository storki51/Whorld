<h3>Installing</h3>

<p><b>Installing for the first time:</b>

<p>Whorld is distributed as a .zip file. Unzip the distribution file, using WinZip or an equivalent program, and then double-click on Whorld.msi to launch the installer. The installer is about as simple as an installer can be: just keep hitting "Next."

<p>Note that by default, Whorld is installed for the current user only. This means additional users must manually create desktop and start menu shortcuts to Whorld. If this is inconvenient, you may prefer to install Whorld for all users, using the following procedure:

<ol>
<li>If Whorld is already installed, <a href="../Getting_Started/Uninstalling.htm">uninstall</a> it.
<li>Unzip the distribution file into a folder, if you haven't already.
<li>In that folder, double-click AllUsers.bat to launch the installer, and then proceed as usual.
</ol>

<p>Whorld is optimized for 1024 x 768 resolution, with 32-bit color. At higher resolutions, lines may look too thin, and <a href="../Loose_Ends/Performance.htm">performance</a> may suffer, especially in <a href="../Modes/Full_Screen.htm">full-screen</a> and <a href="../Modes/Veejay_Mode.htm">Veejay mode</a>. At lower resolutions, lines may look jagged, though performance may improve. Whorld does not change the display resolution; you must change it yourself, using the Windows Control Panel.

<p><b>Upgrading a previous installation:</b>

<ol>
<li>Unzip the distribution file to a folder, if you haven't already.
<li>In that folder, double-click Upgrade.bat to launch the installer.
<li>In the installer, select the "Repair" option.
</ol>

<p>Note that double-clicking Whorld.msi won't work: you will get the message "Another version of this product is already installed".
