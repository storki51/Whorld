<h3>Video origin</h3>

<p>The <a href="../Video_Overlay/Video_overlay.htm">video overlay</a> has its own origin, which is independent of the <a href="../Modes/Origin_Motion.htm">drawing origin</a>. The video origin only has an effect when the output is <a href="../Effects/Mirror.htm">mirrored</a>. In mirror mode, only a quarter of the video frame is used. The video origin allows you to continuously change which portion of the video is used as the mirror source. By default the video origin is (0, 0), i.e. the upper-left quadrant of the video.

<p>To change the video origin manually, move the mouse while holding down the <span class="key">Shift</span> key. The video origin can also be automated, so that it makes random jumps in sync with the <a href="../Master_Controls/Tempo.htm">tempo</a>; to enable or disable random jumps, use <span class="cmd">Image/Video/Random Origin</span>, or <span class="key">Ctrl+Shift+R</span>. Note that in either case, video origin motion is affected by <a href="../Master_Controls/Damping.htm">Damping</a>.
