<h3>Video overlay</h3>

<p>As of version 1.5, a video clip can be overlaid onto the animation, using various types of <a href="../Video_Overlay/Video_blending.htm">blending</a>. Videos are handled in much the same way as <a href="../Patches/Patches.htm">patches</a>, and must be inserted into a <a href="../Playlists/Playlists.htm">playlist</a> beforehand, using the <a href="../Playlists/Playlist_dialog.htm">playlist dialog</a>. Videos can be <a href="../Video_Overlay/Playing_videos.htm">played</a> via shortcut keys or MIDI, or automatically <a href="../Video_Overlay/Cycling_videos.htm">cycled</a> in sync with the master <a href="../Master_Controls/Tempo.htm">tempo</a>. The most recently played videos are <a href="../Video_Overlay/Video_cache.htm">cached</a> for easy access.

<p>Note that only AVI files are supported; other video formats, including MPEG, Quicktime, Windows Media, etc. are NOT supported. The appropriate codec(s) must be installed on your PC, and other restrictions may apply; see <a href="../Video_Overlay/Encoding_videos.htm">encoding</a>. The free, open-source XVID codec is recommended.
