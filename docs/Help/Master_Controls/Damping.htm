<h3>Damping</h3>

<p>Damping affects <a href="../Modes/Origin_Motion.htm">origin motion</a> and <a href="../Master_Controls/Zoom.htm">zoom</a>, as well as <a href="../Parameters/Global_Parameters.htm">global parameters</a>: it makes them more fluid, but less precise. Damping acts like a low-pass filter: it reduces the high-frequency components (jerkiness) of motions, making them smoother. Damping ranges from 0 (none) to nearly 100 (maximum). Note that when damping is set to its maximum value, the origin and zoom respond to changes very slowly, and may appear to be stuck.

<p>Damping can be changed via the Master dialog, MIDI, or the <a href="../Modes/Mouse_Modes.htm">mouse wheel</a>. It can be also be changed via <span class="cmd">Image/Damping/More</span> (<span class="key">Up Arrow</span>) and <span class="cmd">Image/Damping/Less</span> (<span class="key">Down Arrow</span>); the arrow shortcuts are handy if the mouse has no wheel.
