<h3>Tempo</h3>

<p>This setting controls the tempo, in beats per minute (BPM). When <a href="../Modes/Origin_Motion.htm">origin motion</a> is set to Random, the tempo determines how frequently the origin jumps to a new position. If origin motion isn't set to Random, tempo has no effect on the origin. As of version 1.5, the tempo also controls the rate of <a href="../Video_Overlay/Cycling_videos.htm">video cycling</a>.

<p>The origin jumps can be synchronized to music by adjusting the tempo appropriately. This is particularly effective when the animation is <a href="../Effects/Mirror.htm">mirrored</a>. It's also interesting to smooth the jumps, using <a href="../Master_Controls/Damping.htm">damping</a>.

<p>The tempo is typically synchronized manually, via <a href="../Loose_Ends/Tap_Tempo.htm">tap tempo</a>, though it can also be synchronized to <a href="../Options/MIDI/MIDI_sync.htm">MIDI clocks</a>. The Master dialog's tempo controls aren't useful for synchronization, but they do allow a specific tempo to be entered directly.
