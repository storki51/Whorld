<h3>Trail</h3>

<p>This setting determines whether <a href="../Modes/Origin_Motion.htm">origin motion</a> keeps the rings together, or spreads them out. Trail ranges from 0 (none) to 100 (maximum). When trail is zero, the rings stay together; as trail increases, rings further from the origin lag behind, creating a slinky effect. When trail is at maximum, rings don't move from their birth positions. In short, trail controls how long it takes for the rings to recenter themselves around a new origin.

<p>Trail is essential for simulating elastic motion, e.g. jellyfish, worms, etc. The best results are achieved by combining trail with <a href="../Master_Controls/Damping.htm">damping</a>, and limiting the number of rings, via the <a href="../Master_Controls/Rings.htm">rings</a> setting. Random origin motion works well, because the pauses give the rings a chance to catch up periodically, instead of remaining spread out all the time. If the rings are <a href="../Effects/Fill.htm">filled</a>, it may be more effective to draw them in <a href="../Effects/Convex.htm">convex</a> mode, so that the innermost rings are always visible.

<p>Trail can be changed via the Master dialog, MIDI, or by moving the <a href="../Modes/Mouse_Modes.htm">mouse wheel</a> while holding down the <span class="key">Shift</span> key.
