<h3>Spread</h3>

<p>This setting, combined with the <a href="../Master_Controls/Copies.htm">Copies</a> setting, allows you to draw multiple groups of rings at once. Copies is the number of groups to draw, and Spread is their distance from the <a href="../Modes/Origin_Motion.htm">origin</a>, in pixels. See Copies for details.
