<h3>Rings</h3>

<p>This setting limits the number of rings to a specific value, ranging from 0 to 999. A value of 1000 disables the limiting, and the value is displayed as "MAX" to indicate this. The default value is "MAX".

<p>The number of rings is also limited by the <a href="../Master_Controls/Canvas_scale.htm">canvas size</a>. Setting Rings to "MAX" allows rings to die "naturally", i.e. when their all vertices are off-canvas. Setting Rings below "MAX" can cause rings to die before their time.

<p>Limiting the number of rings is essential for solving <a href="../Loose_Ends/Performance.htm">performance</a> problems, but it's also interesting as a special effect, because it provides a means of simplifying the composition.

<p>The ring limit can be changed via the Master dialog, via MIDI, or in <a href="../Modes/Veejay_Mode.htm">Veejay mode</a> ONLY, by moving the <a href="../Modes/Mouse_Modes.htm">mouse</a> vertically while holding down the <span class="key">Alt</span> key.
