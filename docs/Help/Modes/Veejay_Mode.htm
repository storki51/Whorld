<h3>Veejay Mode</h3>

<p>Veejay mode is intended for live performances. It's similar to <a href="../Modes/Full_Screen.htm">full-screen</a> (again, the Whorld image fills the entire screen) but with an important difference: no other windows of any kind are allowed. Veejay mode "locks out" (disables) any feature or key that could cause Whorld, another application, or Windows itself to display a dialog, menu, or other window. Even the standard Windows task-switching keys are disabled, except <span class="key">Ctrl+Alt+Delete</span>. This prevents accidental disruptions, e.g. showing the desktop, exiting the application, etc.

<p>Veejay mode also eliminates <a href="../Loose_Ends/Tearing.htm">tearing</a>, provided DirectDraw and Exclusive mode are enabled in the <a href="../Options/Display/DirectDraw.htm">DirectDraw</a> options.

<p>To enter Veejay mode, use <span class="cmd">Window/Veejay</span> or <span class="key">Ctrl+F11</span>. Note that the ONLY way to exit Veejay mode is by pressing <span class="key">Ctrl+F11</span>. In a new installation, entering Veejay mode causes a warning dialog to appear. To permanently disable this warning, check the "don't show me this again" checkbox.

<p>The following commands are disabled in Veejay mode:

<p>File/New
<br>File/Open
<br>File/Save
<br>File/Save As
<br>File/Print
<br>File/Print Preview
<br>File/Print Setup
<br>File/Export Bitmap
<br>File/Load Snapshot
<br>File/Movie/Play
<br>File/Movie/Export
<br>File/Exit
<br>View/Parms
<br>View/Numbers
<br>View/Crossfader
<br>View/Playlist
<br>View/Master
<br>View/Options
<br>View/Midi Setup
<br>Window/Full Screen
<br>Window/Detach

<p>The following commands, which normally display a file dialog, use the <a href="../Options/Folder/Default_output_folder.htm">default output folder</a> instead:

<p>File/Save Mix
<br>File/Take Snapshot
<br>File/Movie/Record
