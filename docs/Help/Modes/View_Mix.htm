<h3>View Mix</h3>

<p>This setting determines whether the animation is controlled by the document, or the crossfader. When View Mix is off, the animation is controlled by the document. When View Mix is on, the animation is controlled by the <a href="../Crossfader/Crossfader_dialog.htm">crossfader</a>. To toggle this setting, use <span class="cmd">View/Mix</span> or <span class="key">Ctrl+M</span>.

<p>Edits made via the <a href="../Patches/Parameters_dialog.htm">parameters dialog</a> may or may not affect the animation, depending on the combination of View Mix and <a href="../Patches/Edit_Selection.htm">edit selection</a>. If you're editing the document, View Mix should be off, so you can see the effect of your edits. If you're <a href="../Playlists/Playing_patches.htm">playing patches</a> from a <a href="../Playlists/Playlists.htm">playlist</a>, View Mix should be on, because the playlist sends its output to the crossfader; see <a href="../Modes/Signal_Flow.htm">Signal Flow</a>.

<p>Note that playing a patch from a playlist automatically turns View Mix on. If you're editing a patch and the image isn't changing accordingly, it's probably because you turned View Mix on without realizing it.
