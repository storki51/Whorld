<h3>Editing Snapshots</h3>

<p>A <a href="../Snapshots/Snapshots.htm">snapshot</a> can be edited to a limited extent, e.g. by changing its origin, effects, zoom, and colors, though rings can't be added or deleted. To edit a snapshot, you must first <a href="../Snapshots/Load_Snapshot.htm">load</a> it. After editing it, save your changes by <a href="../Snapshots/Take_Snapshot.htm">taking</a> another snapshot. Note that you will <em>not</em> be prompted to save your changes, so to avoid confusion, only edit one snapshot at a time. For a complete list of the edits that can be performed on a snapshot, see <a href="../Modes/Pause.htm">Pause</a>.
