<h3>Load Snapshot</h3>

<p>This command restores one or more <a href="../Snapshots/Snapshots.htm">snapshots</a> that were previously captured using the <a href="../Snapshots/Take_Snapshot.htm">Take Snapshot</a> command. To load snapshots, use <span class="cmd">File/Load Snapshot</span> or <span class="key">Ctrl+L</span>. The command displays a special file dialog that allows <a href="../Loose_Ends/Selecting_items.htm">multiple files</a> to be selected, and also allows snapshots to be <em>previewed</em>.

<p>To preview the snapshots, check the "Preview" box in the lower-left corner of the file dialog, and select the files one at a time; note that preview doesn't work with multiple selections.

<p>To load the snapshots, press "Open" in the file dialog. Loading snapshots causes Whorld to enter <a href="../Snapshots/Snapshot_Mode.htm">Snapshot Mode</a>, which allows the snapshots to be viewed, printed, exported, etc.
