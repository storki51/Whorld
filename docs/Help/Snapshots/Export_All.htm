<h3>Export All</h3>

<p>To open <a href="../Snapshots/Snapshots.htm">snapshots</a> in other applications, you must first <em>export</em> them as bitmaps. It's possible to export them one at a time using <span class="cmd">File/Export</span>, but for large numbers of snapshots this becomes tedious. Export All allows you to export multiple snapshots at once, using the same settings for all of them.

<p>To export multiple snapshots, first <a href="../Snapshots/Load_Snapshot.htm">load</a> them, and then select <span class="cmd">Snapshot/Export All</span>. Whorld displays a folder dialog, allowing you to choose a destination for the bitmaps. After you select a folder and press "OK", the <a href="../Loose_Ends/Export.htm">Export dialog</a> is displayed; configure the options as desired, and press "OK" to begin the export.
