<h3>Invert Color</h3>

<p>While this mode is enabled, the colors of both new and existing rings are inverted. The <a href="../Parameters/Background_Hue.htm">background color</a> is not affected. Inversion is <em>not</em> the same as rotating the hue 180° (e.g. by doing two <a href="../Color/Rotate_Hue.htm">Rotate Hue</a> commands), because it's done in RGB space, and therefore flips the lightness as well as the hue. Note that in Invert Color mode, the direction of the <a href="../Parameters/Lightness.htm">Lightness</a> parameter is reversed: increasing it makes the image darker.
