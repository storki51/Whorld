<h3>Rotate Hue</h3>

<p>This command rotates the <a href="../Color/Color_Model.htm">hues</a> of both new and existing rings by 90°. The <a href="../Parameters/Background_Hue.htm">background color</a> is not affected. The rotation is cumulative, so after four repetitions you're back where you started. Only hues are affected, not lightness or saturation. The effect is more dramatic when hue cycling is limited; see <a href="../Color/Loop_Hue.htm">Loop Hue</a>.

<p>Hues can be changed gradually via MIDI, or by moving the <a href="../Modes/Mouse_Modes.htm">mouse</a> vertically while holding down the right button.
