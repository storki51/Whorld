<h3>Loop Hue</h3>

<p>The image color normally cycles around the entire <a href="../Color/Color_Model.htm">hue</a> wheel, at the speed and direction dictated by the <a href="../Parameters/Color_Speed.htm">Color Speed</a> parameter. In Loop Hue mode, cycling is limited to a <em>subset</em> of the hue wheel. The <em>size</em> of the subset is determined by <a href="../Master_Controls/Hue_loop_length.htm">Hue Loop Length</a>. Loop Hue affects new rings only; existing rings are unaffected.

<p>Enabling Loop Hue causes the hue to immediately reverse direction: the current hue becomes one end of the loop, and the loop length determines the other end. For example, suppose the hue is currently 240° (blue), Color Speed is positive (clockwise), and the loop length is 60°. In this case, enabling Loop Hue causes the hue to cycle counterclockwise until it reaches 180° (cyan), at which point it reverses direction again and heads back towards blue.

<p>A hue loop can be moved around the hue wheel, using the <a href="../Modes/Mouse_Modes.htm">mouse</a> or the <a href="../Color/Rotate_Hue.htm">Rotate Hue</a> command. Manual hue changes are more dramatic when cycling is limited; 360° cycling tends to upstage them.
