<h3>Playlists</h3>

<p>A playlist is a list of <a href="../Patches/Patches.htm">patches</a>. As of version 1.5, a playlist may also contain <a href="../Video_Overlay/Video_overlay.htm">videos</a>. Playlists are created and edited via the <a href="../Playlists/Playlist_dialog.htm">playlist dialog</a>. To open a playlist, use <span class="cmd">File/Playlist/Open</span>; to save it, use <span class="cmd">File/Playlist/Save</span>. Playlists can also be opened and saved from within the playlist dialog, which has its own menus.

<p>You can <a href="../Playlists/Playing_patches.htm">play patches</a> from the playlist manually, via the keyboard or <a href="../Playlists/MIDI_Mapping.htm">MIDI</a>, or Whorld can <a href="../Playlists/Autoplay.htm">autoplay</a> the patches, like a jukebox. The transitions can be made gradual, using automated <a href="../Playlists/Crossfading_patches.htm">crossfades</a>.

<p>Patches can be assigned shortcut keys, which allow them to be played via the keyboard in <a href="../Modes/Veejay_Mode.htm">Veejay mode</a>. Patches can also be organized into <em>banks</em>. A playlist has twenty banks, and each bank can hold an unlimited number of patches.

<p>A playlist doesn't actually store patches; instead, it stores <em>links</em> to patches. Consequently, when you modify a patch, any playlists that include that patch get the new version automatically. If patches are moved or renamed, broken links can occur; see <a href="../Playlists/Missing_Files.htm">missing files</a>.

<p>Playlists also store other data, including the effects, master dialog settings, and <a href="../MIDI/MIDI_Setup.htm">MIDI setup</a>. In general, all non-patch settings are stored in the playlist, except for the options, which are stored in the registry.
