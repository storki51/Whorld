<h3>Editing playlists</h3>

<p><a href="../Playlists/Playlists.htm">Playlists</a> are created and edited using the <a href="../Playlists/Playlist_dialog.htm">playlist dialog</a>. The playlist dialog has its own menus, which differ from the main window's menus. This topic refers to the playlist dialog's menus, and their <a href="../Loose_Ends/Playlist_Shortcuts.htm">shortcuts</a>.

<p>To insert <a href="../Patches/Patches.htm">patches</a> into a playlist, use <span class="cmd">File/Insert Patches</span>, or press <span class="key">Insert</span>. A file dialog is displayed, allowing you <a href="../Loose_Ends/Selecting_items.htm">select</a> the patches. Press "Open" to insert the patches; they're inserted before the list's current position. To use the context menu instead, right-click the insert position, and choose <span class="cmd">Insert Patches</span>. Patches can also be inserted by dragging them onto the playlist from Windows Explorer.

<p>The playlist dialog has clipboard support, and the standard editing commands (copy, cut, paste, delete) behave as usual. For example, to copy patches to a different bank:

<ol>
<li>Select the desired patches.
<li>Copy them to the clipboard, via <span class="cmd">Edit/Copy</span> or <span class="key">Ctrl+C</span>.
<li>Use the Bank drop-list to select the destination bank.
<li>Paste the patches, via <span class="cmd">Edit/Paste</span> or <span class="key">Ctrl+V</span>.
</ol>

<p>To use the context menu instead, select the desired patches, right-click one of them, choose <span class="cmd">Copy</span>, select the destination bank, right-click the insert position, and choose <span class="cmd">Paste</span>.

<p>Patches can also be moved around within the list by dragging them. To move multiple patches at once, select them, and then drag the entire selection.
