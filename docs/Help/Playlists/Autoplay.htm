<h3>Autoplay</h3>

<p>Whorld can play <a href="../Patches/Patches.htm">patches</a> from a <a href="../Playlists/Playlists.htm">playlist</a> automatically, like a jukebox; this is <em>autoplay</em> mode. Autoplay reduces the need for user interaction; it's how the <a href="../Modes/Demo_Mode.htm">demo</a> works. Note that autoplay can only play patches in the current bank. Autoplay can be configured, as follows:

<ul>

<li>To enable or disable autoplay mode, use <span class="cmd">View/Autoplay</span> or <span class="key">Ctrl+A</span>; you can also do this via the play button in the <a href="../Playlists/Playlist_dialog.htm">playlist dialog</a>, or via MIDI.

<li>To select sequential versus random play, use the Shuffle button in the playlist dialog.

<li>To set the interval between patch changes, use the playlist dialog's Patch seconds edit box; you can also set this via MIDI.

<li>To make the transitions instantaneous or gradual, set the crossfade time. This can be done in various ways; see <a href="../Playlists/Crossfading_patches.htm">crossfading patches</a>.

</ul>
