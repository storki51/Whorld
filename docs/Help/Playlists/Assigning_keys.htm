<h3>Assigning keys</h3>

<p>Before you can <a href="../Playlists/Playing_patches.htm">play patches</a> from the keyboard, you must first assign keys to them, using the <a href="../Playlists/Playlist_dialog.htm">playlist dialog</a>. You can assign keys individually, or let Whorld make the assignments for you. Each bank of patches has its own key assignments, but within a given bank, a key can only be assigned to one patch at a time.

<p>To let Whorld make the assignments, choose <span class="cmd">Edit/Auto-Assign Keys</span> from the playlist dialog's menus. This assigns keys A..Z to the first 26 patches, in QWERTY order.

<p>Individual assignments are made using one of two methods: the "Assign key" hotkey control, or the <span class="key">Shift</span> key. To use the hotkey control, do the following:

<p><ol>
<li>Select the desired patch in the playlist, by left-clicking it.
<li>Left-click the hotkey control.
<li>Press the key you want to assign to the patch. Only keys A..Z are accepted. If the key is already assigned to another patch in the current bank, a warning dialog is displayed.
<li>Press <span class="key">Enter</span> or <span class="key">Tab</span> to complete the assignment.
</ol>

<p>The <span class="key">Shift</span> key method is considerably easier: select the desired patch in the playlist, and while holding down the <span class="key">Shift</span> key, press the key you want to assign. Again, only keys A..Z are accepted.

<p>To remove one or more key assignments, first select the patches, and then choose <span class="cmd">Edit/Remove Key</span> from the playlist dialog's menus, or press <span class="key">Backspace</span>. You can also do this via the context menu: select one or more patches, right-click one of them, and then choose <span class="cmd">Remove Key</span>.
