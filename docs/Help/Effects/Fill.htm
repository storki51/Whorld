<h3>Fill</h3>

<p>This effect causes rings to appear as filled areas instead of lines. For each ring, the area bounded by it and the previous ring is filled, using the same color that would have been used to draw the line. A ring can be both filled and drawn as a line; see <a href="../Effects/Outline.htm">Outline</a>.

<p>To enable/disable fill for new rings only, use <span class="cmd">Image/Fill</span> or <span class="key">F6</span>. Since existing rings are unaffected, the change occurs gradually. To enable/disable fill for both new and existing rings, use <span class="cmd">Image/Invert/Fill</span> or <span class="key">Shift+F6</span>.

<p>Fill increases graphics overhead and may reduce <a href="../Loose_Ends/Performance.htm">performance</a>.
