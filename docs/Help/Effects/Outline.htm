<h3>Outline</h3>

<p>This effect causes <a href="../Effects/Fill.htm">filled</a> rings to be outlined (i.e. drawn as lines), using the background color. Rings that aren't filled are unaffected.

<p>Generally, filled rings tend to look gaseous without outlining, and faceted with it. Note that without outlining, neighboring filled rings of the same color are indistinguishable, though this isn't necessarily a problem.

<p>To enable/disable outlining for new rings only, use <span class="cmd">Image/Outline</span> or <span class="key">F7</span>. Since existing rings are unaffected, the change occurs gradually. To enable/disable outlining for both new and existing rings, use <span class="cmd">Image/Invert/Outline</span> or <span class="key">Shift+F7</span>.

<p>Outline increases graphics overhead and may reduce <a href="../Loose_Ends/Performance.htm">performance</a>.
