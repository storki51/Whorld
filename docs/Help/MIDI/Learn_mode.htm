<h3>Learn mode</h3>

<p>Assigning MIDI messages via <a href="../MIDI/MIDI_Setup.htm">editing</a> requires you to know which messages your device sends, and on which channels. Whorld can also "learn" the MIDI assignments, in which case you don't need to worry about those details. To use "learn" mode, do the following:

<ol>
<li>Check the "Learn" box in the upper-left corner of the <a href="../MIDI/MIDI_Setup.htm">MIDI Setup</a> dialog.
<li>Left-click an edit box of the property you want to control; it doesn't matter which edit box, so long as the edit cursor is somewhere in that row.
<li>On your MIDI device, twiddle the control that you want to assign to that property. To assign a note to the property, press and release the note. The property's message type, channel, and controller number should "snap" to the correct value. Be careful not to accidentally touch controls or notes that you've already assigned to other properties, otherwise those assignments will have to be redone.
<li>Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each property you want to control.
<li>Uncheck the "Learn" box.
</ol>
